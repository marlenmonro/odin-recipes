        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>In the best examples I've had of beef bulgogi in Korean restaurants, the meat, 
        while tender, still had a little bit of chewiness to it. You can control texture 
        by the thickness or thinness of the slices and how long you marinate them. But 
        this Korean-style BBQ recipe has a fairly fast-acting marinade, so I go with an 
        hour or two.</p>

                <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil, plus more for brushing skillet</li>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Mix garlic, grated onion, grated ginger, toasted sesame oil, and 
                    brown sugar together in a mixing bowl. Stir in grated pear, soy sauce, 
                    and red pepper flakes.</li>
                <li>Transfer meat to marinade and toss to coat on all sides. Cover and 
                    refrigerate, 1 to 2 hours. </li>
                <li>Season meat with salt and a drizzle of vegetable oil. Toss.</li>
                <li>Brush a cast iron skillet with a little vegetable oil and place 
                    over high heat. When the skillet is very hot, add beef in a single 
                    layer and cook until meat begins to caramelize around the edges and
                    moisture begins to evaporate, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Serve over hot 
                    rice and top with green onion slices.</li>
            </ol>
