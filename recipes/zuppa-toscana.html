                <li>6 medium potatoes, thinly sliced</li>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Cook Italian sausage and red pepper flakes in a Dutch oven over 
                    medium-high heat until crumbly, browned, and no longer pink, 
                    10 to 15 minutes. Drain and set aside.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cook bacon in the same Dutch oven over medium heat until crisp, 
                    about 10 minutes. Drain, leaving a few tablespoons of drippings 
                    with the bacon in the bottom of the Dutch oven. Stir in onions 
                    and garlic; cook until onions are soft and translucent, 
                    about 5 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Stir in chicken broth and bring to a boil over high heat. 
                    Add potatoes and simmer until fork tender, about 20 minutes. 
                    Reduce heat to medium; stir in cream, cooked sausage, and spinach. 
                    Cook and stir until spinach has wilted and sausage is warmed through; serve. 
                </li>
            </ol>
